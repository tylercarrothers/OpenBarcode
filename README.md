# OpenBarcode
Python program for sorting barcode and dirty int data, outputting available barcodes and used barcodes.
 
### "How Do I Prepare the Data Beforehand?"
First, you grab the CSV data of your library from Populi, before pasting the CSV into Excel. You then copy all of the barcodes ***(NUMERICAL ONLY)*** and paste them into this website, and let the website sort out all of the data for you. 

# FAQs
##### - How do I input the text?
Use CTRL-D, CTRL-Z, or CTRL-C (if none of the others work). We're looking for an EOFError or a KeyboardInterrupt, so it shouldn't be that bad.

##### - I have a more in-depth question! Where can I ask for your help?
I'm still not entirely sure how to use Github, but there might be comments or whatnot.
